Basic breakout game coded during the Unity lecture of October 17, 2013.

In addition to what shown in class, this code include the main menu,
in which the buttons are implemented as colliders positioned over
the play and credit signs.

The code should be modified  to

- improve the ball trajectory which sometime can become too horizontal
- add the next levels since at the moment the game stops as all the
  bricks are destroyed.
